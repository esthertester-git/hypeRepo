		<div>Getting to know your customers and discovering their motivations, challenges, and goals is at the root of creating traction and generating growth for your business. 

Whether you are new to the subject or are seeking a refresher, this course will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Customer Discovery and present opportunities to dive deep into the practicalities of securing and conducting interviews that can render valuable information for your startup.
</div>
		<div>Customer Discovery</div>
		<div>presents</div>
		<div>Blank’s work heavily influenced and was integrated into the Lean Startup methodology, and in his second book, The Startup Owner’s Manual, Blank further refined the customer development process into the following 4 steps:
State your hypothesis
Test your problem
Test your solution
Pivot or proceed
</div>
		<div>FOUNDATIONS: A Brief History of Customer Discovery</div>
		<div>In 1990, Steve Blank introduced a methodology for customer development that was intended to help startups and entrepreneurs improve their products' success. In his first book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, Blank outlined a systematic process for guiding entrepreneurs in their search for a “repeatable and scalable business model”. The process was founded on a simple and fairly obvious idea: talk directly to your customers (or potential customers)! 
Blank’s message to founders was clear: “get out of the building” and put yourself in front of customers. The outcome of this, he argued, was a direct path to validation.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>In this 3-minute video entitled Customer Discovery - How to Build a Startup, Steve Blank provides an overview of these steps and explains the importance of the cyclical process of customer discovery in validating your business model.
You likely recognize these steps as the key steps of the build-measure-learn loop. To learn more about the build-measure-learn loop and using sprints to gain valuable insights for customer discovery, check out Propel’s “Lean Sprints” course.

		<div>So, talking to customers is how you uncover problems worth solving, but let’s be honest, standing in front of customers, talking to them, observing them, and extracting insights is not that easy. In addition to not knowing how to start a conversation with customers (which we cover in “Methods to Help You Interview”), many founders are challenged by:




This is where frameworks can really help. In the next module, we’ll examine the Jobs-To-Be-Done framework and the Customer Forces Canvas in some detail and show you how to use these tools to help guide your customer discovery process and address some of these challenges.
</div>
		<div>Given the range of ways we can reach out to and connect with customers, talking to customers may sound like a pretty straightforward task. In your day-to-day communication, you likely have a range of ways to connect with others, most of which are aided by technology. But, a word of caution: while technology can certainly help in verifying insights from customer interviews, technological solutions such as emails or surveys should not replace engaging with your customers directly.
</div>
		<div>FOUNDATIONS: Talking to Customers</div>
		<div>In this short video, Marcel Lebrun talks about the insights he gained from getting out of the building and talking to (and observing) his customers in their own environment. As you will learn, the impacts of customer discovery to his startup were crucial to its ultimate success.
Talking to customers can be tough (and even sometimes scary). In “Methods to Help You Interview”, we’ll show you how to set up, run, and extract insights from your customer interviews.

		<div>FOUNDATIONS: Continuous Innovation Mindset</div>
		<div>In Leanstack, Ash Maurya frames the work of customer discovery, positioning it as a central mechanism for cultivating a mindset of continuous innovation. 
The formula:continuous innovation = continuous discovery + continuous learning
There’s a lot of “continuous” in this formula and you may be wondering what this all means for you and your time. Fear not! Ash clarifies that to adopt and embody this mindset does not mean endless interviewing. Rather, it means: 
Baselining what you know, and;
Continuously monitoring what is changing
